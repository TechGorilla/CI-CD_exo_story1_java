# CI-CD_exo_story1_java

## Story 1 :
   
 >   As a DevOps engineer, I want to have a CI/CD pipeline for my application. \
 >       The pipeline must build and test the application code base. \
 >       The pipeline must build and push a Docker container ready to use. \
 >       The pipeline must deploy the application across different environments on the target       infrastructure.
    
_Bonus point: Separate the backend and the frontend in different pipelines and containers._
